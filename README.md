# MRTCCSL

Consists of the following tools:
- [x] simulator that outputs traces using several strategies (with at most step, at least step, random)
    - almost complete, only few constraints are left to implement
    - works
- [ ] analyzer of the real-time and asynchronous fragment by using constraint programming (polyhedra) and k-induction-like reasoning about only live schedules.
    - only basic structures are made
    - not implemented
- [ ] parser
    - should parse textual version of MRTCCSL
    - not implemented
